SsTD - Slow'n silly Tri Draw

Implementation of Roger Alsing's idea of recreating existing images by drawing polygons.
It uses a simple hill-climping mutation optimization algorithm that gradually 
adds, removes, reorders, recolors and moves triangles.

Based on OpenGL ES 2.0, GLM.
Runs on Android and Windows.

Warning
--------------------------
Quite some of the code in this project is still supbar and quick prototyp material.
Also the code is far from optimized and contains one or the other hack.
